Since water is two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen, moisture cannot form if either component is missing.Hence oxygen absorbers. I have not had a single failure since I began using them.They're not terribly exciting, but they are effective and I recommend them for anyone who dehydrates foods.Perhaps I oversimplified too much.For water to form in a previously dry area (read \"dehydrated\" as in water-removed), both hydrogen and oxygen are necessary.When the oxygen is taken out of the mix(as in: absorbed), it leaves only the hydrogen, which cannot turn itself into water. Hydrogen in and of itself is not harmful to food, and being a lighter-than-air gas, it rises until it finds enough oxygen molecules to form water.hw","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2010-12-17 17:22:40"},{"user":"MonCherie","content":"I was watching videos about food dehydrating on YouTube. There was a woman who was super serious about dehydrating.I mean, she was storing her dehydrated food in a vacuumed bag,then put into another vacuumed bag followed by a food storage bucket (that was what she did for the food she was keeping for long term storage.)She placed the O2 absorbers into each bag.The food that she had dehydrated & intended on using sooner instead of later went into Mason jars. She also put the O2 packs ( 1 per quart) into the jars. Then she used a lid & ring, as for canning. The really neat part was, the lid actually sealed because of the O2 absorbers. It really does work because I've tried it.Now I can dehydrate food & it won't get soggy as time goes by. Most of the food I plan on dehydrating will be stored in vacuum sealed bags but the food for immediate use will be stored in Mason jars with O2 absorbers and canning lids & rings. By using the canning lids you can tell if the O2 absorbers are actually working because the bubble in the canning lid flattens & seals the jar. You don't have to seal the jar with the vacuum /sealer. It really works!I noticed many people said their absorbers were junk after opening them. Just make sure to put them into a vacuum sealed bag or jar & they should be fine. Don't leave them loose, exposed to the air. After I opened the bag I removed what I needed & vacuum sealed the rest of the packs. I noticed that the pink indicator turned violet in the few seconds it took to remove 3 packs and seal the remainding packs. Not to worry, the indicator turned pink again after vacuum sealing. I know the packets are still good because several days later I removed a few more O2 absorbers. Again, the indicator turned violet in 5 seconds of air exposure but returned to pink after vacuum sealing. I guess when they no longer seal a Mason jar lid to the jar, then I'll know they aren't good anymore.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-09-14 17:22:40"},{"user":"CA Tina","content":"Bought a dehydrator for the first time had no clue how to use these packets.I opened the package, not knowing that you have to put it immediately back into an airtight container again.Went to google how to store dry foods on the internet - when I came back, the whole bag was warm!I panicked and thought I was going to burn the house down - or, that it might explode!I am not a chemist and have long forgotten anything I've ever learned from high school.Had to go back and google how to use these things!I wish the package had large warning labels, or IMPORTANT PLEASE READ instructions in the box - if it did, I didn't see it.I need bifocals and couldn't read whatever little prints are on the package.Now, am not too certain if they're still good or not.I used a few with some dry cereal and iheard the jars pop and seal.Am glad to learn about these handy little packs though, will find them most useful.Since my sweetie died I've had more time to think about things that I've taken for granted all our life.I guess we were out enjoying out lives too much and didn't realize this as an option.I'm looking forward to dehydrating oranges, bananas, fruits, vegetable chips, jerky, herbs and teas; of course for storing my sugar, flour, rice beans.Over all my 30+ married life, have thrown away so much food because never stored anything properly.Flour would sit on my shelf that I would use once or twice - then, it would taste horrible after several months of non-use, I end up throwing it all away.This should preserve the life of my dry foods much longer.A much appreciated product that I wish I'd of used years ago!Looking forward to canning and preserving more foods throughout the rest of my life.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2012-12-16 17:22:40"},{"user":"R.

I was working as fast as I could, and I have a Foodsaver Vac Sealer so I resealed the main package as quick as I could. The eye turned a few shades towards purple, but the next day it was bright pink again as the rest of the packets had probably absorbed what little O2 got in.
